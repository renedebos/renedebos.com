# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Context

This is the renedebos.com website, which hosts the Hannan audio archive — live music recordings by Jerry Hannan, Mad Hannans, and Sean Hannan. Audio files are stored in Cloudflare R2 and sourced from Google Drive.

The two large WAV files in `~/` are local staging copies for direct rclone uploads. Most files are accessed via the `gdrive:` remote pointing at a shared Google Drive folder.

## rclone Remotes

- **`gdrive:`** — Google Drive (shared-with-me). Source of truth for all recordings.
  - Primary path: `gdrive:DAT Tapes/DAT Tapes WAV Files/Hannans`
  - Requires `--drive-shared-with-me` flag when listing/copying
- **`r2:`** — Cloudflare R2. Archive destination.
  - Bucket: `r2:hannan-audio`
  - Requires `--s3-no-check-bucket` flag for all operations

## Common Commands

All common operations are in the `Makefile`:

```bash
make refresh                          # regenerate drive_names.txt and r2_names.txt
make diff                             # show files in Drive not yet in R2
make status                           # print counts for Drive, R2, and missing
make upload FILE="filename.wav"       # copy a file from Drive to R2
```

To upload a local staging file from `~/` directly to R2:
```bash
rclone copy ~/"<filename>" r2:hannan-audio --progress --s3-no-check-bucket
```

## MCP Tools Available

The session has Google Drive and Cloudflare Developer Platform MCP tools available, useful for inspecting Drive files and R2 bucket contents without dropping to the shell.
